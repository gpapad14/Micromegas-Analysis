# Data Analysis code for Micromegas study with ROOT (C++).

This folder includes codes in C++ for ROOT, which is a Data Analysis Framework developed by CERN. This is my main work during my internship in CEA, Saclay (2018). The goal of this code is to analyze the data coming from a Micromegas detector in a form of ".mca" files, giving a result which characterizes properties of the detector in particular conditions. Most importantly, my goal was to create a code that can manipulate any number of files, even if the user adds or deletes files, and minimize the "human factor" i.e. reduce the number and the importance of all the parameters that have to be given by the user to the minimum. To run this code, someone needs to use the ROOT package and have at least one file to analyze. Two random images showing the result of the analysis can be found in the folder.
